1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Ans. The relationship bteween the "Product" and "product_Category" entities from the above diagram is many-to-one relationship, meaning that many products can belong to one category.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Ans. To ensure that each product has a valid category, the category_id in the "Product" table should be set up as a foreign key that references the id of the "Product_Category" table. Additionally, constraints should be added to the category_id field to ensure it is not null and that it matches an existing id in the "Product_Category" table. In database terms, this is enforced through referential integrity.
